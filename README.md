This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to borrow a variable mutably and immutably simultaneously within the same scope. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` offers a corrected version.  The error arises from Rust's ownership and borrowing system, designed to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. The solution involves restructuring the code to avoid conflicting borrows.
